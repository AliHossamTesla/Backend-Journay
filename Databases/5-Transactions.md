# 5. Transactions & Concurrency  

This note covers **transactions, concurrency, and recovery mechanisms** â€” the foundation for reliable DB operations.

## ðŸ“Œ ACID properties  
- **Atomicity** â†’ all or nothing.  
- **Consistency** â†’ DB moves from one valid state to another.  
- **Isolation** â†’ transactions appear independent.  
- **Durability** â†’ committed data survives crashes.

## ðŸ“Œ Concurrency problems: dirty reads, lost updates, phantom reads  
- **Dirty read:** read uncommitted changes from another transaction.  
- **Lost update:** two transactions overwrite each other.  
- **Non-repeatable read:** same query returns different results within one transaction.  
- **Phantom read:** new rows appear/disappear in repeated queries.

## ðŸ“Œ Isolation levels (RU, RC, RR, Serializable)  
- **Read Uncommitted (RU):** allows dirty reads.  
- **Read Committed (RC):** prevents dirty reads.  
- **Repeatable Read (RR):** prevents dirty + non-repeatable reads.  
- **Serializable:** strictest, full isolation, but can reduce concurrency.

## ðŸ“Œ Locking: row-level, table-level, shared vs exclusive locks  
- **Row-level locks:** fine-grained, higher concurrency.  
- **Table-level locks:** coarser, simpler but reduces concurrency.  
- **Shared (S) lock:** multiple transactions can read.  
- **Exclusive (X) lock:** only one transaction can write.

## ðŸ“Œ Deadlocks & prevention  
- **Deadlock:** two transactions wait for each otherâ€™s locks.  
- **Prevention techniques:**  
  - Ordering resource access.  
  - Timeout detection.  
  - Wait-Die / Wound-Wait schemes.

## ðŸ“Œ WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) & recovery  
- **WAL principle:** log changes **before** applying them to the database.  
- Enables crash recovery â†’ replay committed transactions, undo incomplete ones.  
- Core to Postgres & InnoDB durability.

## âœ… Next Steps  
1. On your **Library System DB**:  
   - Run two concurrent transactions (Postgres `psql` sessions).  
   - Test anomalies: dirty read, lost update.  
   - Switch isolation levels (`SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`).  
2. Use `EXPLAIN` + `pg_locks` in Postgres to inspect locks.  
3. Enable WAL logs in Postgres and simulate crash recovery with `pg_resetwal`.  
4. In **Spring Boot + JPA**:  
   - Use `@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.REPEATABLE_READ)` and test concurrency.  
   - Observe differences between isolation levels in practice.
